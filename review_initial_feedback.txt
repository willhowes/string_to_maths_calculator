don't be afraid to take a while refactoring

red-green should only take a minute or two - solve the quickest way possible

- quality coding is in the refactor stage

- main issue syntax. understanding ruby better

- to enable powerful refactors need to understand the language better

- when lots of ifs statements:
-- identify all the lines are the same above any lines that are different
--

- every time we add a new test there will usually be a new refactor that needs
to be done

- If we don't regularly refactor then we have to do a long refactor
- Ask yourself: is there a better way to code this? Criticise your code - review it.

Django framework for python (full stack)
- Java for back end ( a 'C type' language)
- Web - React, Angular, Django, Rails
- IoT - C,
- Web - exploding! egs: MERN (react) - MEAN (angular)
- backend - python, java, C++
- data science
- BUT MAIN ADVICE: KEEP CODING! And yes do a project.
